<button class="collapsible" style="font-size:50%">Growing Up</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>I grew up in Apple Valley, California. When I was nine years old,
        my family moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon. I was a very shy kid
        and didn't make friends until I found a groups of kids that liked computers.
        I ended up becoming part of that clique and diving into the monsterous
        community that is the computer lovers. I also have done music since I was
        eight years old, which has shaped the person I've become.
